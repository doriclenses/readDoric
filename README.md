# How to read .doric files

## Python

You can see the python code by simply opening the [___ReadDoricFile.ipynb___](https://github.com/doriclenses/readDoric/blob/main/ReadDoricFile.ipynb).

Three possible options on how you can implement this code for your data analysis:
1. Copy this notebook to your Google drive by clicking on [![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)]([https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JI43Y2PLC28qyj_m6qR6iTj9Rvr8PSFc#scrollTo=mSOGdYSj6jZp](https://colab.research.google.com/github/doriclenses/readDoric/blob/main/ReadDoricFile.ipynb)), upload the ___Console_Acq_0000.doric___ example file to your Google drive as well. Then follow the steps of the notebook.
2. Download ___ReadDoricFile.ipynb___ notebook and ___Console_Acq_0000.doric___ example file to your computer. Then follow the steps of the notebook. We assume that you have [Anaconda](https://docs.anaconda.com/free/anaconda/install/windows/) installed.
3. Copy parts of the code from ___ReadDoricFile.ipynb___ notebook to your python code.
